# Cmus lyric viewer

Shows the lyric (if available) of the current song being played in cmus (the
default cmus-status-display format)

TODO :^) :

- [ ] Display song in cmus-status.txt and recognize if its playing currently or if it is an old status
- [ ] Search for currently playing song.
- [ ] Scrolling.
- [ ] vim like interface (:q, /search).
- [ ] create lyric database so we don't have to repeat searches for the same
  song/offline usage.
